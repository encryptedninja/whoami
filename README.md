**Penetration Testing** & **Red Teaming**, and other type of automations.

```bash
root@kali:~# ./repo-overview
⚡ The public repos here aren’t just random code — they’re fast-access arsenals.
Whether you’re looking for a --help shortcut, a quick payload tweak, or a config reference...
this is your command center.

root@kali:~# ./philosophy
🧠 Built for clarity. Tuned for speed. No fluff.
Just essentials — fast.

root@kali:~# ./disclaimer
🕵️‍♂️ Not going full cloak-and-dagger here — no deep dives into Red Team TTPs, infra setups,
or how to make your C2 look like a weather app.
This space is for quick-access tinkering, not a full-blown adversary simulation manual.
📎 Think of it as Post-it notes for hackers.

root@kali:~# ./farewell
💾 Stick around. Clone what you need. Modify what you must.
And may your shells always return. 🐚
